Department Store Theft-Detector:

*In order to speed up processing of returns at Nordstromâ€™s, the customer service department
wants an electronic detector device. Its goal is to both determine those items that have been
discounted, so that the proper rebate can be calculated, as well as help find shoplifters returning
their ill-gotten gains.
There are six products being sold. The UPC code for each is shown, as well as whether it was
ever on sale (i.e. sold at a discounted price), and whether it is expensive, and thus is marked
when sold.
